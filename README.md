# Node_Server
My first Node.Js server that routes basic pages.
This strictly Node.js without any frameworks or third-party dependencies

# Github-Actions

GitHub actions was integrated with an on-push event that runs the actions pipeline.

After a successful build, the pages are available and are routed to the various setup pages.
